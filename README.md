This project was forked from the Class Github.  The class known as EE120 at SDSMT had Zackery Holloway and Ethan Thomson as TA for the 2025 Spring Semseter.  Thye were tasked with creating a microcontroller project for students.  This code project is the result of that task.

# Project Overview and Helpers 

## Overview

The multimeter is an indispensable tool for any electronics project, as it helps overcome countless challenges during project completion. This project will demonstrate how to create a cost-effective digital multimeter using an Adafruit ESP32-S3 REV TFT board. This multimeter is capable of measuring voltage, current, resistance, and capacitance. Upon completing the project, you will have your own multimeter and a better understanind of Ohm's Law. 

## What You Will Learn 

- Understand the concept of a multimeter and its importance in electronics projects

- Learn how to measure voltage accurately

- Discover the techniques for measuring current effectively

- Master the art of measuring resistance with precision

- Explore the measurement of capacitance using ESP32

- Build a Multimeter (voltmeter, ammeter, ohmmeter and capacitan) with ESP32

## What Is A Multimeter?

In simple words, a multimeter is a device that converts electrical parameters such as voltage, current and so on to a language we can understand. First prototypes of this widely used device (called galvanometer) were created in 1820. Despite being only capable of measuring current, they became an essential part of any electronics projects. Knowing how to use a multimeter is essential for any electronics project

Multimeters are generally categorized as analog and digital. Analog multimeters use physical pointers to display values and are being used less and less. However, digital multimeters benefit from digital displays and are much more popular.

## What Parameters Does A Multimeter Measure?

Multimeters measure various parameters. However, the most important ones are voltage, current and, resistance. Other parameters include capacitance, self-inductance, frequency, diode test, connectivity test, brightness, transistor test and, so on.

For this project, we will make a multimeter that can measure voltage, current, resistance and capacitance.
